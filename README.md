# Fullstack-JavaSpringBootAndReact-

Here I intend to create a simple projects such as called DojoBlogs using JavaSpringBoot as Back-end and React as Front-end.
The reason I am using these two technologies is that I feel most comfortable with.


Here are the steps to get java backend server running:

Vistited website called: start.spring.io
Maven, Java as language, latest version of spring boot and java version 11 are clicked and appointed for this small project
Last step is to add Sprin web as dependency and I was good to go
Also, last but not least the project is open by opening pom.xml as a project
